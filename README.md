## Contents
- `data_cleaning.R`: Preprocesses digestion data (filtering, summarizing with dplyr).
- `stats_analysis.R`: Performs one-way ANOVA and t-tests to compare protein digestibility.
- `visualizations.R`: Creates publication-quality bar and box plots using ggplot2.
- `sample_data.csv`: Mock dataset simulating protein digestibility and enzyme activity.
